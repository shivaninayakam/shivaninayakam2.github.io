Agnes attended a convent-run primary school and then a state-run secondary school. 
As a girl, she sang in the local Sacred Heart choir and was often asked to sing solos. 
The congregation made an annual pilgrimage to the Church of the Black Madonna in Letnice, and
 it was on one such trip at the age of 12 that she first felt a calling to a religious life. Six years later, in 1928, an 18-year-old Agnes Bojaxhiu 
decided to become a nun and set off for Ireland to join the Sisters of Loreto in Dublin. It was there that she took the name Sister Mary Teresa 
after Saint Thérèse of Lisieux.

A year later, Sister Mary Teresa traveled on to Darjeeling, India, for the novitiate period; 
in May 1931, she made her First Profession of Vows. Afterward she was sent to Calcutta, 

she taught geography and history and dedicated herself to alleviating the girls' poverty through education.

On May 24, 1937, she took her Final Profession of Vows to a life of poverty, chastity and obedience.
Mother Teresa continued to teach at Saint Mary's, and in 1944 she became the school's principal. 
Through her kindness, generosity and unfailing commitment to her students' education, she sought to lead them to a life of devotion to Christ. 
"Give me the strength to be ever the light of their lives, so that I may lead them at last to you," she wrote in prayer.</i>
