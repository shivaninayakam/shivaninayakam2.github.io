On August 26, 1910,  Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, who later became known as Mother Teresa, was born in Skopje,
 the current capital of the Republic of Macedonia. Her parents, Nikola and Drana Bojaxhiu, had given birth to five children,
 but only three had managed to survive. Her father was a contractor, employed in a successful construction business. 
They were a dedicated Catholic family, participating in many of the activities at the local church. As a girl, 
she sang in the local Sacred Heart choir, often being asked to sing solos. Unfortunately, in 1919, when Mother Teresa had only nine years of age, 
her father had died. With this event, life changed overnight as their mother acquired total responsibility for the family, 
instilling for her a deep devotion to charity. During her early years,  she was captivated by the stories of missionary life and service.
 When Mother Teresa had eighteen years of age, she decided to pursue the path that seems to have been unfolding throughout her life. In 1928, 
Mother Teresa had chosen to begin her religious life in Ireland, far from her family and the life she'd known.
 In her later years, Mother Teresa would become a model humanitarian for many generations.
