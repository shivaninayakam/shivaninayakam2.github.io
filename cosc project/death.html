<h3><u>DEATH AND SAINTHOOD</u></h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;"><i>After several years of deteriorating health, in which she suffered from heart, lung and kidney problems,
 Mother Teresa died on September 5, 1997, at the age of 87. In 2002, the Vatican recognized a miracle involving an Indian woman named Monica Besra,
 who said she was cured of an abdominal tumor through Mother Teresa's intercession on the one year anniversary of her death in 1998. She was beatified as
 "Blessed Teresa of Calcutta" on October 19, 2003 in a ceremony led by Pope John Paul II. 

Since her death, Mother Teresa has remained in the public spotlight. In particular, the publication of her private correspondence in 2003 caused a
 wholesale re-evaluation of her life by revealing the crisis of faith she suffered for most of the last 50 years of her life.

In one despairing letter to a confidant, she wrote, "Where is my Faith—even deep down right in there is nothing, but emptiness & 
darkness—My God—how painful is this unknown pain—I have no Faith—I dare not utter the words & thoughts that crowd in my heart—&
 make me suffer untold agony." 

For her unwavering commitment to aiding those most in need, Mother Teresa stands out as one of the greatest humanitarians of the 20th century. 
She combined profound empathy and a fervent commitment to her cause with incredible organizational and managerial skills that allowed her to develop a 
vast and effective international organization of missionaries to help impoverished citizens all across the globe.</i>
